## Introduction

This research applies international accounting frameworks and standards for Natural Capital Accounting in Hawaiʻi- The [UN System of Environmental- Economic Accounts](https://seea.un.org/ecosystem-accounting/) and the [IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (GET) 2.0.](https://iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/iucn-global-ecosystem-typology)

The aim is to create ecosystem accounts that track annual changes to Hawaiian ecosystems in a consistent way. This allows policy makers, conservation managers, and interested parties, to track and compare changes in ecosystem extents and conditions over time and across different geographies in the Main Hawaiian Islands and the world.

## Preliminary Findings

-   Ideally ecosystems are best classified by Ecosystem Functional Groups according to IUCN. However, multiple research and data limitations persist in Hawaiʻi.

-   Crucially, most ecological/ biological research do not cover the entire area of the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) nor are they routinely updated over long periods of time.

-   Also, some functional groups (eg. Tropical/Subtropical lowland rainforests) are better studied than others (eg. Anchialine caves)

## Ecosystem Extent

Hawaiʻi is diverse! Our pilot ecosystem extent accounts only cover broadly 12/ **42** EFG that exist in the MHI, for years 2013, 2016, 2019.

## Ecosystem Conditions

Pilot ecosystem condition accounts show changes to ecosystem types based on four condition variables for years 2013, 2016, and 2019-

1.  Area burnt;
2.  Rainfall;
3.  Temperature;
4.  NDVI ("vegetation greenness")

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rainfall Conditions

Many Moku have seen significant drop in rainfall over the forests:

## Rainfall Conditions

This graph calculates the difference in mean monthly rainfall (baseline vs. 2019) for tree cover ecosystem type:

![](images/tree_rain_chge.png){fig-align="center"}

## Temperature Conditions

In forests, mean annual temnperatures have risen far more between 2013 to 2019 as compared to the baseline.

![](images/tree_temp.png){fig-align="center"}

## Temperature Conditions

Large temperature increases were recorded primarily in the big island forests:

![](images/tree_temp_chge.png){fig-align="center"}

## NDVI Conditions

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) makes use of the near-infrared and red bands of the EM spectrum to determine "greenness" of an area (ranging from -1 to 1). High values can mean denser vegetation:

## NDVI Conditions

Forests in central Maui appear to have negative scores compared to the baseline, while most moku have recorded increases in 2019 compared to the baseline:
