## Introduction

This research applies international accounting frameworks and standards for Natural Capital Accounting in Hawaiʻi- The [UN System of Environmental- Economic Accounts](https://seea.un.org/ecosystem-accounting/) and the [IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology (GET) 2.0.](https://iucn.org/resources/conservation-tool/iucn-global-ecosystem-typology)

The aim is to create ecosystem accounts that track annual changes to Hawaiian ecosystems in a consistent way. This allows policy makers, conservation managers, and interested parties, to track and compare changes in ecosystem extents and conditions over time and across different geographies in the Main Hawaiian Islands and the world.

## Preliminary Findings

-   Ideally ecosystems are best classified by Ecosystem Functional Groups according to IUCN. However, multiple research and data limitations persist in Hawaiʻi.

-   Crucially, most ecological/ biological research do not cover the entire area of the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) nor are they routinely updated over long periods of time.

-   Also, some functional groups (eg. Tropical/Subtropical lowland rainforests) are better studied than others (eg. Anchialine caves)

## Ecosystem Extent

Our pilot ecosystem extent accounts cover broadly 12/ 42 EFG that exist in the MHI, for years 2013, 2016, 2019. Here are some highlights:

## Ecosystem Conditions

Pilot ecosystem condition accounts show changes to ecosystem types based on four condition variables for years 2013, 2016, and 2019-

1.  Area burnt;
2.  Rainfall;
3.  Temperature;
4.  NDVI ("vegetation greenness")
